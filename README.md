## LockSysID - Overview

Electronic System based on RFID 125KHz module.<br /> The Project was developed using RFID 125KHz communication. The solution is based on SMART LOCK DOOR, so we have here a Relay OUTPUT, sonorous and light indicator. All these fetures are controlled by [STM32F103Cx](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103c8.pdf).

### Hardware
You can download PCB [Transceiver](/hardware/Transceiver/PCB_Files) and [Receiver](/hardware/Receiver/PCB_Files) designs files. If you'll fabricate the boards, I recommend use the [JLC7628 Stackup](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/impedance?_ga=2.116811712.798095935.1647969093-664896489.1639745533) from JLCPCB.
